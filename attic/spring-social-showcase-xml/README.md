Spring Social Showcase XML
==========================
This sample app is a clone of the spring-social-showcase sample, configured using a mix of Spring's
XML-based and Java-based configuration. It was created primarily to demonstrate Spring Social 1.1's
new XML configuration support. (Specifically, see social.xml.)

This sample app demonstrates many of the capabilities of the Spring Social project, including:
* Connect to Facebook
* Sign in using Facebook

To run, simply import the project into your IDE and deploy to a Servlet 2.5 or > container such as Tomcat 6 or 7.
Access the project at http://localhost:8080/spring-social-showcase
